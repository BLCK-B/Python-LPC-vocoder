This is a test implementation of LPC vocoder cross-synthesis effect and pitch shifting. The processing it close to real-time: on a frame basis. It contains both slow algorithm and FFT implementations.

This project was made to support the development of [Prescient VST](https://github.com/BLCK-B/Prescient-VST). You can find more info there.
